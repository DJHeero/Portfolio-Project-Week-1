  <h1>Portfolio Project</h1>
  <h2>Hello! My name is Darius Johnson</h2>

  <p>This is my first independent project for my HTML and CCS coding course. This is a HTML page I have created to show off my skills and understanding of the courses I have studied for the past two weeks. It is my hope to use this page as both a starting point of my foray into coding, as well as a visual representation of where I started in coding when I compare my progress over the next few weeks.</p>

  <div class="box1"><p>Here is a list of my favorite kinds of foods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Parmesan</li>
      <li>Fried seafood</li>
      <li>Japanese curry rice</li>
      <li>Strawberry Milkshakes</li>
      <li>Cheesecake</lI>
      <li>Enchiladas</li>
    </ul></div>
  
  <div class="box2"><p>And here is a list of five of my favorite instruments, top to bottom</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cello</strong></li>
      <li>Accoustic Guitar</li>
      <li>Piano</li>
      <li>Violin</li>
      <li>Saxophone</li>
    </ol></div>

  <p>Another piece of trivia about me is whether I am a cat person or dog person. I like <em>both</em>, but am partial to one over the other as I've had two as pets in my past. Can you guess which? I will give you a hint...</p>

  <p> A great place to see videos of dogs, and many more things is <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. I spend an <span class="important">embarrassing</span> amount of time there watching a variety of things from cooking recipies, documentaries and travel blogs, as well as funny animal videos.</p>
