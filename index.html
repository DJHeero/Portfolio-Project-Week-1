  <h1>Portfolio Project</h1>
  <h2>Hello! My name is Darius Johnson</h2>

  <p>This is my first independent project for my HTML and CCS coding course. This is a HTML page I have created to show off my skills and understanding of the courses I have studied for the past two weeks. It is my hope to use this page as both a starting point of my foray into coding, as well as a visual representation of where I started in coding when I compare my progress over the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>Here is a list of my favorite kinds of foods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Parmesan</li>
      <li>Fried seafood</li>
      <li>Japanese curry rice</li>
      <li>Strawberry Milkshakes</li>
      <li>Cheesecake</lI>
      <li>Enchiladas</li>
    </ul>
  
  <p>And here is a list of five of my favorite instruments, top to bottom</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cello</li>
      <li>Accoustic Guitar</li>
      <li>Piano</li>

      <li>Saxophone</li>
    </ol>
